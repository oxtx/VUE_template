      <h2>Fanexus Community Guidelines</h2>
      <h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Group of people</i> includes demographics of race/ethnicity,
        nationality, gender identity, sexuality, age, religious affiliation,
        neurodiversity and disability, but also encompasses people who are
        affiliated due to their shared fandom, interests or choice of lifestyle.
        For example, “fans of X”, “y/z shippers”, or the polyamourous community.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Undeniable likeness</i> refers to an artistic depiction of a real
        person that is easily identifiable as that person without context. For
        example, if a piece of art depicts a character portrayed by a real
        actor, and someone who is unfamiliar with the character but familiar
        with the actor sees the art and recognises it as a picture of the actor,
        it is an undeniable likeness. Highly stylised cartoons that eliminate
        much distinguishing facial structure (e.g. cartoon styles with hugely
        exaggerated eyes and extremely simplistic noses and mouths) would
        probably not be undeniable likenesses.
      </p>
      <h3>HARASSMENT AND THREATS</h3>
      <p>
        Fanexus endeavours to be a welcoming platform, where users can feel
        secure that they won’t encounter abuse. Ergo, the following won’t be
        tolerated on Fanexus:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Death threats, rape threats, suicide-baiting, or any other sentiments
          expressing an intent or desire to see an individual or group of people
          physically/sexually harmed or dead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sentiments wishing/demanding intense and prolonged
          psychological/emotional suffering for an individual or group, e.g.
          wishing that someone never recovers from depression. This doesn’tt
          include statements expressing a desire for someone to experience more
          constructive negative emotions, e.g. hoping a person gets perspective
          on negative actions, such as a bully or bigot feeling a need to
          change.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sentiments that an individual or group of people are fundamentally
          inferior, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. This includes
          statements that are clearly intended to degrade or dehumanise, e.g.
          calling groups of people “freaks” or “degenerates” in a negative way,
          or using slurs in an insulting manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Content clearly intended to humiliate another Fanexus user, e.g. a
          drawing or photo of a user in a humiliating situation posted without
          their consent.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Criticism of individuals and groups of people is acceptable on Fanexus
        when it doesn’t cross these lines, e.g. “Luddism is a misguided and
        backwards philosophy” would be an acceptable statement of opinion, but
        “Luddites are subhumans” would not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hate and bigotry expressed by characters within fictional works is of
        course acceptable, unless there is any compelling evidence to suggest
        this fiction is being used as a veil for the creator’s hateful
        sentiments. An obvious example of this would be a fic that simply reads
        <i
          >“Y/Z shippers are disgusting,” said Y as he killed all Y/Z
          shippers.</i
        >
        These instances will be judged on a case by case basis by the mod team,
        and the creators’ behaviour outside their works will be taken into
        consideration when making these judgements.
      </p>
      <h3>COPYRIGHT AND REPOSTING</h3>
      <p>
        Fanexus recognises that creators have the right to benefit from the
        moral and material interests in works that they have authored. At the
        same time, we also recognise that no creator works alone, and that
        borrowing from those who came before is a long-established and essential
        part of the creative process—especially in the case of fan works. To
        strike this balance, Fanexus encourages users to post their own content,
        while giving credit, where appropriate, to any previous creators whose
        work is referenced, quoted, remixed, or otherwise used as direct source
        material.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not repost unaltered copies of someone else’s content unless you have
        their permission to do so. Fanexus will respond to copyright claims
        received from users or third parties in accordance with the applicable
        law in our hosting jurisdiction, which may result in content being taken
        down until that claim has been resolved.
      </p>
      <h3>PRIVACY</h3>
      <p>
        As a registered user of Fanexus, we will collect the following data from
        you for the purpose of maintaining your account: your chosen username,
        your email address, and your date of birth if you are under the age of
        18. We will also use cookies to enable some of the site’s functionality,
        such as ensuring that you remain logged in as you browse the site. You
        may limit the use of cookies in your web browser settings or using a
        third-party browser plugin, but this may affect the functionality of the
        site. If you are between the ages of 13 and 16 and a resident or citizen
        of a country in which the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
        applies, you must obtain written permission from a parent or legal
        guardian to the processing of your personal data, and provide this to us
        if requested. You are entitled to receive a copy of any information that
        we hold about you upon request. If you require us to remove or correct
        any of the data that we store about you, we will be happy to do so.
      </p>
      <h3>AGE</h3>
      <p>
        You must be 13 years or older in order to use Fanexus. If you are under
        18, you will be asked to provide your date of birth on sign up, and
        adult-only material will be invisible to you until you turn 18. Underage
        users who are found to be lying about their age in order to access adult
        content will be banned.
      </p>
      <h3>SEXUAL CONTACT WITH MINORS</h3>
      <p>
        Adults must not sexually solicit minors for real-life or roleplay
        purposes, or deliberately expose minors to pornographic content.
      </p>
      <h3>CSEM, ZOOPHILIA, AND RAPE</h3>
      <p>
        Photos and video, whether real or doctored, that depict or are visually
        indistinguishable from real depictions of minors in a state of graphic
        nudity, engaged in sexual activities, or presented in a sexualised
        manner, are illegal and posting them will result in an instant ban and a
        report to the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        All pornographic artworks and animations depicting real minors are
        prohibited; this includes erotic artworks/animations of fictional
        characters portrayed by underage actors, if the depictions are
        undeniable likenesses of the actors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fanexus reserves the right to use the following third-party resources
        for scanning uploaded content to identify, block, and report known child
        sexual abuse images: NCMEC Industry hash list, NCMEC NGO hash list.
        Text-only posts will not be automatically scanned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Real images and video of humans engaged in sexual activities with
        animals, and real images and video depicting real non-consensual sexual
        acts between humans, will similarly result in a ban and a report.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any posts encouraging or glorifying real, illegal adult/minor sex,
        human/animal sex, or molestation/rape, will result in a ban.
      </p>
      <h3>INVOLUNTARY PORNOGRAPHY</h3>
      <p>
        Any nude or sexual photos or video depicting a real person, whether
        real, or faked with the intent to appear genuine, must not be posted
        without that person’s ongoing permission. Sexual images and video
        include things such as “creepshots” and “upskirt” imagery. Doing so will
        result in a ban and report to the appropriate authorities. This does not
        include artworks and animations of adults that can’t be mistaken for
        real photos or video.
      </p>
      <h3>REAL PERSON FICTION</h3>
      <p>
        Real person fiction (RPF) - which includes written, visual, and audio
        content - is permitted, so long as it doesn’t violate our rules on
        harassment, doxxing, CSEM or misinformation. E.g. it is acceptable to
        write a piece of fiction that contains inaccurate information about a
        real person, so long as it’s clear that the story is meant to be
        fictitious as opposed to biographical. Private information about a
        person that is not readily available online must not be incorporated
        into RPF without consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users must respect the privacy of the people featured in RPF, and not
        purposely expose them to any such content that features them without
        their consent. RPF that involves romantic shipping or NSFW material
        about real people who are still alive or who have died within the last
        five years must not be publicly viewable, i.e. it must be posted to a
        members-only community and/or posted to a privacy group that only allows
        selected users to see the content.
      </p>
      <h3>TAGS</h3>
      <p>
        Purposefully vandalising the tags will be penalised. Vandalising covers
        the following behaviours:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Breaking logical relationships between tags (e.g. removing “James T
          Kirk” as a child tag of “Star Trek”).
        </li>
        <li>
          Creating illogical relationships between tags (e.g. making “James T
          Kirk” the parent tag of “David Bowie”).
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding inaccurate/irrelevant information to the description for a tag.
        </li>
        <li>Deleting tags that are in use without good reason.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Guidelines for editing the tags can be found
        <router-link class="link" :to="{ name: 'tagging-basics' }"
          >here</router-link
        >.
      </p>
      <h3>PROMOTION OR GLORIFICATION OF SELF HARM</h3>
      <p>
        Don’t use Fanexus to encourage or glorify self-harm; this includes but
        is not limited to posts and comments that encourage the following
        behaviours, or present them in a positive light:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cutting</li>
        <li>Eating disorders</li>
        <li>Suicide</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fiction, art and personal accounts exploring these topics, including
        from the perspective of characters who do view them in a positive light,
        are however allowed.
      </p>
      <h3>REAL GORE AND DEATH</h3>
      <p>
        Just as we consider it a violation to post nude/sexual imagery or video
        of a person without their consent, we also consider it a violation to
        post images or video of a real person’s traumatic injury or death
        without consent. Therefore, images and video depicting real human death
        and/or real, graphic human gore are not permitted, save for the
        following exceptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Images and video of surgeries, autopsies and mummified/preserved dead
          bodies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Well-known historical images and video of human death and serious
          injury (e.g. the suicide of Evelyn McHale, the self-imolation of Thích
          Quảng Đức, famous war photography, etc).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Images and video of animal gore and death are permitted, however images
        or video of animals being tortured are prohibited, unless they are
        clearly for educational purposes (e.g. in the context of a documentary
        about animal rights).
      </p>
      <p>
        All content depicting graphic gore and death must carry a warning tag;
        please refer to the <b>MANDATORY TAGS</b> section of this document for
        more details.
      </p>
      <h3>MISINFORMATION</h3>
      <p>
        Fanexus is not to be used to spread misinformation such as libel or
        false “facts”, e.g. we will not permit users to make up false statistics
        about vaccination-related deaths and present them as factual. Posting
        doctored images, especially those intended to embarrass or defame
        another person, and claiming that they’re real is not allowed. If you
        posted this content out of ignorance, mistakenly believing it was real,
        there will be no penalty and we’ll simply have the misinformation
        removed, but if you repeatedly post misinformation, we’ll have reason to
        suspect your ignorance isn’t genuine, and there may be a penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Posting harmless lies as a form of comedy is fine, including when
        they’re accompanied by doctored images, but you must be very careful to
        ensure that they are indeed harmless.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of a harmless comedic lie could be, “There’s a secret level
        you can unlock in Mario Galaxy where everyone’s head has been replaced
        with a giant foot.” However, if you then added that in order to unlock
        the level, a player would have to perform an action that could cause
        injury, this would become a potentially harmful lie. Comedic lies made
        about another user can count as libel or harassment if they make the
        target uncomfortable and are posted without consent.
      </p>
      <h3>SPAM</h3>
      <p>
        Spam is prohibited; this includes tagging posts with tags that are
        irrelevant to the content of the post, leaving comments on posts that
        are irrelevant to the post, or creating spambot accounts.
      </p>
      <h3>MISLEADING LINKS</h3>
      <p>
        Don’t post anything containing misleading or hidden links; this includes
        disguising a link as an image without giving any indication that a link
        will be activated when the image is clicked. An exception can be made
        for misleading/hidden links created for the purpose of comedy or
        positivity that redirect to secure and virus-free locations that don’t
        contain any of the content outlined in the <b>MANDATORY TAGS</b> section
        of this document.
      </p>
      <h3>IMPERSONATION, CATFISHING AND BLOCK EVASION</h3>
      <p>
        Do not create blogs under the guise of someone who you are not; this
        includes masquerading as real individuals, organisations and businesses.
        Creating blogs such as roleplay and parody blogs is fine so long as you
        make it clear that you are not actually whoever you are impersonating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not create a new account/alias in order to interact with someone who
        has blocked you, or to interact with someone you know under the guise of
        a different identity with the intent of deceiving or manipulating them.
      </p>
      <h3>DOXXING</h3>
      <p>
        Posting anybody’s private information without their permission is
        prohibited; this includes their photos, contact details, location, place
        of work, family and offline friends, and links to other websites
        (including their other online accounts) that reveal this information.
      </p>
      <h3>ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES</h3>
      <p>
        You may not use Fanexus to commit or facilitate the commission of an
        offense under any law that applies to you directly, or any law that is
        in force in our hosting jurisdiction. Examples include but are not
        limited to trafficking in human beings or illegal substances, violating
        export controls, or violating any court orders or parole conditions that
        apply to you.
      </p>
      <h3>FALSE REPORTS</h3>
      <p>
        Repeatedly logging false reports will result in penalties (i.e.
        reporting another user’s post as CSEM when it clearly is not).
      </p>
      <h3>MANDATORY TAGS</h3>
      <p>
        Certain content must be tagged with the following tags (posts that
        require subtags do not need to be tagged with the parent tag):
      </p>
      <p>#Choose Not to Warn</p>
      <p>
        This tag can be used instead of any of the other mandatory tags listed
        here. If a user is uncertain if the content of their post qualifies for
        any of the other mandatory tags, we recommend the use of this tag. We
        intend to eventually introduce a feature that hides selected tags under
        a spoiler warning, but until that feature is implemented, this tag can
        be used in the place of any mandatory tags that spoil the content of a
        post.
      </p>
      <p>#Death</p>
      <p>
        Posts with content depicting or dealing with death as a central topic
        must have this tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Posts that depict or discuss suicide or suicidal themes require the
        <u>#Suicide</u> subtag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fictional/fandom content in which a major character dies requires the
        <u>#Major Character Death</u> subtag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content that contains imagery of real human death that is permitted
        under the exceptions outlined in the <b>REAL GORE AND DEATH</b> section
        of this document must be tagged with the
        <u>#Real Human Gore/Death</u> subtag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Images of real animal death require the
        <u>#Real Animal Gore/Death</u> subtag. Images of animal remains that
        have been prepared for cooking/eating do not require this tag.
      </p>
      <p>#Graphic Violence/Gore</p>
      <p>
        This tag is to be used for any content that depicts or discusses graphic
        violence/gore; we define this as anything involving the
        visual/descriptive loss or destruction of body parts, the exposure of
        bones/internal organs, and/or a potentially fatal amount of blood loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content that contains imagery of real human gore that is permitted under
        the exceptions outlined in the <b>REAL GORE AND DEATH</b> section of
        this document must be tagged with the
        <u>#Real Human Gore/Death</u> subtag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Images of real animal gore require the
        <u>#Real Animal Gore/Death</u> subtag. Images of animal remains that
        have been prepared for cooking/eating do not require this tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>#Graphic Violence/Gore</u> is a child tag of the <u>#nsfw</u> tag.
        Using the <u>#nsfw</u>
        tag or its children makes a post invisible to minors and non-registered
        users.
      </p>
      <p>#Rape/NonCon</p>
      <p>
        This tag is to be used for any content that depicts or discusses
        rape/sexual abuse/sexual assault. Please use the <u>#CSA</u> subtag for
        posts discussing sexual abuse of minors.
      </p>
      <p>#Underage</p>
      <p>
        This tag is to be used for content that involves fictional minors
        (humans under the age of 18) in sexual situations. You can use this tag
        for non-human characters if you feel it is appropriate, but due to the
        ambiguity created by rapidly ageing aliens, sentient toys, talking
        animals, and the like, it is not mandatory. If you are unsure if your
        content fits this criteria, we strongly encourage use of the
        <u>#Choose Not To Warn tag</u>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <u>#CSA</u> tag is only required for fictional works in which a
        minor experiences rape/sexual abuse/sexual assault. As fictional minors
        don’t necessarily mature physically, mentally, and emotionally at the
        same rate as real minors, fictional adult/minor relationships don’t
        automatically require the <u>#CSA</u> tag (but do require the
        <u>#Underage</u> tag).
      </p>
      <p>#Graphic Nudity/Sexuality</p>
      <p>
        This tag applies to real, digital, and illustrated nudity and real,
        digital, illustrated and written explicit sexual content. If the nudity
        is graphic enough or the sexuality explicit enough that it would get
        someone in trouble in an office workplace if they were seen looking at
        it, it needs to be tagged.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>#Graphic Nudity/Sexuality</u> is a child tag of the <u>#nsfw</u> tag.
        Using the <u>#nsfw</u> tag or its children makes a post invisible to
        minors and non-registered users.
